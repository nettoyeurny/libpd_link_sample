Sample app using Link and libpd
=====

Quick start: In the parent directory of your LinkKit directory (i.e., /some_path/LinkKit/..), say

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:nettoyeurny/libpd_link_sample.git

Open libpd_link_sample/PdLink.xcodeproj in Xcode. You should be able to run the sample app without having to make any changes.

The directory libpd_link_sample/libpd/abstractions contains an abstraction, abl_link~.pd, that mimics the behavior of the Link external, as well as a help patch that explains how to use it.
